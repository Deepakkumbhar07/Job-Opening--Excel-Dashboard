üìä Job Opening-Excel-Dashboard

Short Description / Purpose

This project analyzes job openings across industries, education requirements, job status, and locations. The dashboard provides insights into which industries have the highest openings, the qualifications in demand, and geographical job distributions, helping businesses, policymakers, and job seekers understand current employment trends.

Tech Stack üíª

The dashboard was developed using Microsoft Excel, Power BI, or Tableau. PivotTables and PivotCharts were used to summarize the data, and slicers/filters were applied for interactive exploration by industry, education level, and AI impact. The visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, and line charts for clear comparison and trend analysis.

Key Insights üîç

Manufacturing and Finance lead in the number of job openings, followed closely by Healthcare, Entertainment, and IT. Certain roles such as Insurance Claims Handler, Accounting Technician, and Land/Geomatics Surveyor show a rising demand, while jobs like Mental Health Nurse, Product Development Scientist, and Lawyer show a declining trend. Education requirements vary, with strong demand for Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degree holders, while PhD and High School qualifications appear less common. Geographically, the USA and Canada display the highest concentration of job opportunities, with India, Brazil, and Germany showing moderate levels.

Data Source üìÇ

The analysis is based on a Job Openings dataset, containing attributes such as Industry, Job Role, Education Requirement, AI Impact Level, Job Location, and Job Status (increasing or decreasing).

Features / Highlights ‚ú®

The dashboard includes dynamic filtering by education level, industry, and AI impact. It presents a multi-dimensional breakdown of openings by industry, job role, location, and job trend (increasing or decreasing). The interactive design enables exploration of which jobs are growing or declining across sectors.

Goal of the Analysis üéØ

The main objective is to provide insights into the labor market, helping stakeholders understand where opportunities exist, which qualifications are most in demand, and how AI impacts different job sectors.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals üñº

The Industry chart shows the total job openings across different industries. The Job Status pie chart highlights increasing and decreasing job roles. The Job Openings bar chart lists top job roles by demand. The Job Location line chart displays the distribution of opportunities across countries. Filters for education, industry, and AI impact allow focused analysis.

Business Impact & Insights üí°

The findings reveal strong growth in jobs within manufacturing, finance, and healthcare sectors, while some traditional roles face decline. The demand for higher education qualifications highlights the need for workforce upskilling. With AI influencing industries differently, organizations can prioritize reskilling programs, while policymakers can use these insights to guide education and employment strategies. For job seekers, the analysis highlights the importance of aligning skills with emerging roles to remain competitive in the job market.
